# Econofísica

In this repository it can be found all my projects of this class. I'm using Google Colab, só I will leave the link for the colab, the Jupyter Notebook and the Python 3.x version. The Jupyter and Python version may be different, for reading files, but they should work in the same way. If they don't work as they do in the Colab contact me. The files used for analisys can be found here as well.

The projects are in english.
